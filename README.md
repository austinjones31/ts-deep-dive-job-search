# How a Deep Dive into TypeScript Impacted My Job Search

### Spoiler: TypeScript isn't the only thing TypeScript taught me.

If you're a boot camper like me, you may know that most coding boot camps teach more functional programming than anything. You may also know that languages that strongly favor a functional pattern are the roots of the skills taught at boot camps. This includes languages like JavaScript (JS) and Python. What is the problem with this?

## JavaScript and Python are implicitly typed languages

<strong>Hey Python, at least your type-safe rating is strong.</strong> But JS's type-safe rating is "weak". Let's talk about JS. JavaScript has been the most-loved and the most-hated programming language all at once for quite some time now. A lot of the hate for JavaScript is due to its absence of a strict typing system. Where a language such as Java will crucify you for a null check, JavaScript says, "String divided by string? Yeah, that might work. Let's run it."

For noobs, that's great! For experienced developers with a background in type systems and object-oriented programming (OOP), not so much. They'll likely spend some time scratching their head when working in JS. Actually, an argument can definitely be made that typing systems should be introduced to juniors as early as possible. I definitely agree after learning TypeScript (TS).

## The Decision to Learn TS

After my boot camp concluded, I had trouble deciding what to learn next. I thought about GraphQL, Shopify, a deep dive into Node, and many others. I eventually settled on TypeScript because it can be used anywhere JavaScript is used. If you are a junior developer with experience in JS that is struggling to commit to a new learning topic, look no further than TypeScript.

## What did I learn?

Everything. Er... well, everything about strict typing. I thought possibly TypeScript might be missing some things in comparison to the strict typing systems in Java or C#. I did not find that to be the case. Here is what surprised me... I found that the more I learned about TypeScript, the more I learned about typing systems in general. Eventually, I became completely committed to typing every reference and variable I possibly could in my projects. This saved me a lot of debugging in the long run. Not to mention, there is something charming about being able to document the shape of your models and use said shapes to prevent errors in one fell swoop. Experienced OOP developers are reading this like, "Um... yeah. That's kind of the point. It's called an interface." Right you are! Interfaces and classes are the heart and soul of what will make TypeScript special for you as a junior JavaScript developer.

## Okay, so what did it do for my job search?

Everything.
