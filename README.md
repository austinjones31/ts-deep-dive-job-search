<!-- How a Deep Dive into TypeScript Impacted My Job Search -->

## Spoiler: TypeScript wasn't the only thing TypeScript taught me.

If you're a boot camper like me, you may know that most coding boot camps teach more functional programming than anything. You may also know that languages that strongly favor a functional pattern are the roots of the skills taught at boot camps. This includes languages like JavaScript and Python. What is the problem with this?

## JavaScript and Python are implicitly typed languages

<strong>Hey Python, at least your type-safe rating is strong.</strong> But JS's type-safe rating is "weak". Let's talk about JS. JavaScript has been the most-loved and the most-hated programming language all at once for quite some time now. A lot of the hate for JavaScript is due to its absence of a strict typing system. Where a language such as Java will crucify you for a null check, JavaScript says, "String divided by string? Yeah, that might work. Let's run it."

For noobs, that's great! For experienced developers with a background in type systems and object-oriented programming, not so much. They'll likely spend some time scratching their head at best when working in JS.
